       <p>Hi! My name is Anthony Nokeo. I am an aspiring Front End Web Developer training under the Year Up program at Seattle Central College. I am currently training to become proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am looking to further my skills as a Software Developer and Application Developer. I am excited to break into the tech industry with the intention to diversify the industry and become a contributor to the field. I look forward to working with many diverse teams and different projects.</p>
       
       <p>For a majority of my life, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I graduated from Highline Highschool in 2015 and persued college and for an AA, specializing in Abnormal Psychology although, something was missing. I thought it was I wanted to do but something didn't feel right. I decided to take a year off and eventually heard about YearUp where I am now. YearUp was offering a new track that was coding intensive and I was always was curious about coding. So with that small flame of curiosity, I dove in head-first into the program knowing little to nothing and now I absolutely love coding. I'm grateful for the oppertunity provided and hope to further my skills!</p>
